Welcome to my first responsive website! While the page may appear simple at first glance, a considerable amount of time and effort went into ensuring it is fully mobile-friendly. Below, I'll outline some key features and considerations that went into making this website responsive. Mobile-Friendly Design: The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
Flexible Layout: The layout adjusts dynamically to accommodate different screen resolutions, allowing content to be easily readable and accessible on both large desktop monitors and small mobile screens.
Media Queries: Media queries were used to apply specific styles based on the device's screen size, allowing for targeted adjustments to layout, font sizes, and other design elements.
